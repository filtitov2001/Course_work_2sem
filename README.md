## Formulation of the task


The essence of the assignment was to create a console application using only OOP principles, signals and handlers. 

Develop a program that accepts an integer arithmetic expression without parentheses as input.  All operations have the same priority.  The expression uses the following operators: +, -, *, and $ (integer remainder).  After the execution of each operation, an intermediate result is returned as part of the expression.  The job ends after the last operation is completed.
 
  To use objects: 
  1. To enter the original integer arithmetic expression.  
  2. To practice the operation.  
  3. To display the next intermediate result.
